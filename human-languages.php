The School of Humanities stands at the intersection of traditional wisdom and contemporary relevance, embracing the challenges and opportunities of the emerging global world. The commitment is to nurture minds that understand and appreciate the expansive impact of technological advancement, economic shifts, and socio-cultural dynamics on human existence. The philosophy is rooted in the belief that education transforms individuals into enlightened personalities, bridging the gap between practical knowledge and higher learning. The aim is to maintain this balance, offering a curriculum that is both utilitarian and deeply enriching. The mission extends beyond equipping students with work skills; instead, it aims to foster critical and creative thinking, instilling a comprehensive understanding of languages, social sciences, and humanities. The programs in Hindi, English, Education, History, Sociology, and Political Science are designed not just to impart knowledge but also to develop high-level communication skills, preparing students to face life's varied challenges. A unique feature of the school is its transformational impact â€“ students enter as learners and leave as global citizens, ready to contribute to a multicultural world. The School of Humanities is a vibrant hub of research and education. It offers a range of undergraduate degrees, with options for single or double majors and advanced studies, including MA and PhD programs.
